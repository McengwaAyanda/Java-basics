# Java-basics
fundamentals of java for beginners

Java program is an object-oriented programming language, that means java is the collection of objects, and these objects communicate thhrough method callss to each other to work together.
# Basic terminologies in java
Class: is a blueprint(plan) of the instance of a class(object). It can be defined as a logical template that share common properties and methods
Object: is an instance of a class. it is an entity that has behavior and state.
Method: The behavior of an object is the method.
Instance variables: Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.
# Java Basic Syntax

There are 3 types of comments in Java
1. //Single line comments
2. /*Multi-line comments*/
3. /** Doc comment or docummentation comment*/

The name of a source file should exactly match the public class name with the extension of .java
Java is a case-sensitive language, which means that the identifiers AB, Ab, aB and ab are different in java
The first letter of the class should be in Uppercase
If several words are used to form the name of the class, each inner words first letter should be in Uppercase. underscores are allowed but not recommended. Also allowed are numbers and currency symbols, although the latter are also discouraged because they are used for a special purpose(for inner and annonymous classes).
The method main() is the main entry point into a java program: this is where the processing starts. 
All the methods names should start with a lowercase letter.
If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each first letter of the inner word should be i uppercase.
Identifiers are the names of local variables, instance and class variables, and labels, but also the names for classes, packages, modules and methods. All unicode characters are valid, not just the ASCII subset.
All Identifiers can begin with a letter, a  currency symbol or an underscore. According to the convention, a letter should be lower case for variables. 
Identifiers are case-sensitive and keywords cannot be used as identifiers as they are reserved words and contain special meanings.
